lists     --> can contain any combination of object type using list() function
          --> lists can have named elements, access using $ operator

vector()  --> multiple copies of the same object type
          --> can also use the c() function to concatenate objects together to form a vector
          --> if objects are of different types then R will perform coercion to transform every object into the same type
          --> can name elements using name() or vect <- c(foo=11,bar=2,norf=NA)

as.*      --> explicit type conversion

is.na(), is.nan()   --> undefined or missing data values, NA, NaN
                    --> complete.cases() function performs is.* on multiple vectors

numeric values --> double precision floats, integer uses suffix L, NaN for not a number

factor values   --> factor() function, represent categorical data, ordered or unordered, can be thought of as an integer with a label
                --> see attributes(), table(), unclass()
                --> use gl() function to generate factors and interaction() function for multilevel factors.

attributes() --> access attributes or properties of a data type
              --> dim() and class() are similar

assignment operator is <-, the <<- operator will assign to variables outside of the current scope.
                          For example, to a predefined variable in the parent scope.

%operator% --> %*% will perform matrix multiplication, otherwise if the normal operators are used for vectors or matrices
                you will have element-wise operations

matrix(values,nrow=,ncol=)  --> described as an integer vector of length two (nrow,ncol)
                            --> matrices are created column-wise so the values will iterate down the columns
                            --> can coerce vector objects into matrix objects by assigning a dim() using c() function
                            --> or using the cbind() and rbind() functions, column and row resp
                            --> dimnames() to assign row and column names, generally as a list
                            --> subsetting returns a vector, disable by using drop=FALSE

data.frame()  --> a list of lists, where each element is used to represent a column
              --> read.table(), read.csv()
              --> convert to matrix using data.matrix()
              --> attribute data.names
              --> colnames() to set column names
              --> nrow, ncol for number of rows and columns

subsetting objects in R, aka element access and slicing
              --> [ , [[, and $ extracts elements of a list or frame by name, be aware of return types
              --> similar to python and matlab, accepts logical indices and expressions
              --> missing indices for a dimension denotes all elements
              --> partial matching using , exact=FALSE
              --> can access using vector indices

paste() --> similar to the string join function in python

identical() --> compare objects

lapply --> functional style similar to map and fold functions. Many versions and also see split().
        --> can use ... notation for passing named function arguments.
apply  --> has special functions defined for matrices such as row and column means or sums. Also see tapply() and mapply().

dates and times
R using the Date package and time follows POSIX
    --> as.Date(), as.POSIXlt() and as.POSIXct() and then check names() or class()
    --> strptime() function is very useful for dealing with strange date formats

reading and writing data
list.files(path=directory, pattern="*.csv")  --> to list files in a directory, use rbind to join multiple data frames

read.table(), write.table()   --> set colClasses using sapply() and class() functions
                              --> also use unix command wc to find row number
read.csv()
readLines, writeLines   --> iterate through a text file
source, dump      --> reading R code files
dget, dput        --> reading R code files
load, save        --> reading in saved R workspaces
unserialize, serilize --> reading R objects in binary form

connection interfaces   --> very similar to python
file()        --> opens connection to a file
gzfile()      --> gzip connection
bzfile()      --> bzip2 connection
url()         --> web page
